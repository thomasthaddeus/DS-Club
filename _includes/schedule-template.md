**Subject:** ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š Data Science Club - Exciting 10-week schedule ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š

Hello, Data Enthusiasts! ðŸ™Œ

We're excited to announce our 10-week schedule for our Data Science Club. If you've ever wanted to explore the world of data science, this is your chance. Everyone is welcome, no matter your experience level. Below you will find the rundown of topics and activities we've planned:

**Week 1 (July 15): Introduction to Data Science**
Brief Introduction to Data Science, its applications, and significance. Ice-breaking activities and brainstorming on some real-world problems where data science can be applied.

**Week 2 (July 22): Introduction to Python**
As Python is a significant language in the data science world, we'll be taking a dive into Python programming. We will cover basics and explore libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

**Week 3 (July 29): Data Visualization**
An overview of data visualization techniques and libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. We will have a mini-project to visualize some real-world data.

**Week 4 (August 5): Introduction to Statistics for Data Science**
Understanding descriptive and inferential statistics and their role in data analysis.

**Week 5 (August 12): Data Preprocessing**
Dealing with missing data, outliers, and normalization. Introduction to the concept of Feature Engineering.

**Week 6 (August 19): Introduction to Machine Learning**
We'll discuss the basics of Machine Learning, types of ML, and its applications. We will focus on a few popular algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees.

**Week 7 (August 26): Advanced Machine Learning**
Continuation from last week, we'll go more in-depth into different ML models like SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

**Week 8 (September 2): Introduction to Deep Learning**
Understand the basics of Neural Networks and how deep learning differs from machine learning.

**Week 9 (September 9): Hands-on Project**
Time to apply what we've learned! We will work on a real-world data science project as a team.

**Week 10 (September 16): Project Presentations and Conclusion**
Final presentations of the project we've been working on. We will also have a discussion on the latest trends in data science and possible career paths.

So that's our exciting schedule for the next 10 weeks. We hope you're excited as we are and looking forward to learning and growing together. Remember, no question is a dumb question, and we're here to support each other on this data journey.

Don't forget to save the dates. Each session will be at 4 pm every Friday. More information to follow soon.

Happy Data Crunching! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

Best Regards,
Your Data Science Club Committee
