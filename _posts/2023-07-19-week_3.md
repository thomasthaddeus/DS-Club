## Part 1: Python Basics

### Variables and Data Types

In Python, we can store information in variables. There are several types of data we can store, including integers, floating point numbers, strings, and Booleans.

   ```python
   # Integer
   x = 10
   print(type(x))

   # Float
   y = 10.0
   print(type(y))

   # String
   z = "Hello, World!"
   print(type(z))

   # Boolean
   a = True
   print(type(a))
   ```

#### Arithmetic Operations

Python supports all the basic arithmetic operations.

   ```python
   # Addition
   print(5 + 5)

   # Subtraction
   print(5 - 2)

   # Multiplication
   print(3 * 3)

   # Division
   print(10 / 2)

   # Exponentiation
   print(4 ** 2)
   ```

#### Logical Operations

Python also supports logical operations, which are often used in conditional statements.

   ```python
   # And operation
   print(True and False)

   # Or operation
   print(True or False)

   # Not operation
   print(not True)
   ```

#### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different computations or actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

   ```python
   # Define a variable
   x = 10

   # If statement
   if x > 0:
       print("x is positive")

   # If-else statement
   if x % 2 == 0:
       print("x is even")
   else:
       print("x is odd")

   # If-elif-else statement
   if x < 0:
       print("x is negative")
   elif x == 0:
       print("x is zero")
   else:
       print("x is positive")
   ```

#### Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

   ```python
   # For loop
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)

   # While loop
   i = 0
   while i < 5:
       print(i)
       i += 1

   # Loop through a list
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```

#### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

   ```python
   # Define a function
   def greet(name):
       return "Hello, " + name

   # Call the function
   print(greet("World"))

   # Function with multiple parameters
   def power(base, exponent):
       return base ** exponent

   # Call the function
   print(power(2, 3))
   ```

### Part 2: Python Data Structures

Python has four basic inbuilt data structures: `Lists`, `Tuples`, `Sets`, and `Dictionaries`.

#### Lists

A list is a collection of items. It is ordered, changeable, and allows duplicate elements.

   ```python
   # Define a list
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   print(fruits)

   # Access list items by index
   print(fruits[0])

   # Change the value of a list item
   fruits[1] = "blueberry"
   print(fruits)

   # Add an item to the list
   fruits.append("orange")
   print(fruits)
   ```

#### Tuples

A tuple is similar to a list, but it is ordered and unchangeable.

   ```python
   # Define a tuple
   fruits_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
   print(fruits_tuple)

   # Access tuple items by index
   print(fruits_tuple[0])

   # Trying to change the value of a tuple item throws an error
   # fruits_tuple[1] = "blueberry"  # This will throw an error
   ```

#### Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

   ```python
   # Define a dictionary
   fruit_colors = {
       "apple": "red",
       "banana": "yellow",
       "cherry": "red"
   }
   print(fruit_colors)

   # Access dictionary items by key
   print(fruit_colors["apple"])

   # Change the value of a dictionary item
   fruit_colors["banana"] = "green"
   print(fruit_colors)
   ```

#### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique items.

   ```python
   # Define a set
   fruits_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
   print(fruits_set)  # Duplicates are removed
   ```

### Part 3: Introduction to Pandas and NumPy

#### Creating arrays in NumPy

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a one-dimensional array
   a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   print(a)

   # Create a two-dimensional array
   b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
   print(b)
   ```

#### Manipulating arrays in NumPy

   ```python
   # Change an element of the array
   b[0, 0] = 10
   print(b)

   # Get the shape of the array
   print(a.shape)
   print(b.shape)
   ```

#### Creating DataFrames in Pandas

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
   df = pd.DataFrame({
       "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
       "Age": [25, 30, 35],
       "Occupation": ["Doctor", "Engineer", "Teacher"]
   })
   print(df)
   ```

#### Manipulating DataFrames in Pandas

   ```python
   # Select a column
   print(df["Name"])

   # Add a new column
   df["Salary"] = [100000, 120000, 90000]
   print(df)

   # Delete a column
   df = df.drop("Age", axis=1)
   print(df)
   ```

#### Reading data from CSV files

   ```python
   # Assuming we have a CSV file "data.csv"
   df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
   print(df.head())
   ```

**Please note**: you'd need to have a `data.csv` file available and replace `data.csv` with the path to your file. Uncomment this section when ready to use.

#### Basic data exploration

   ```python
   # Get the shape of the DataFrame
   print(df.shape)

   # Get information about the DataFrame
   print(df.info())

   # Describe the DataFrame
   print(df.describe())
   ```

## Conclusion

In this lab, we have covered the basics of Python including data types, arithmetic and logical operations, conditional statements, loops, and functions. We've also explored Python's basic data structures and were introduced to the data science libraries Pandas and NumPy. Practice these concepts and get comfortable with them, as they are the building blocks for more complex data science tasks.

Remember, the aim is to create a learning experience where students can get their hands dirty with code while also understanding the theory behind the actions they perform.
