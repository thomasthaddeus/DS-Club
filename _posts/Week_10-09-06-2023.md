# Week 10: Wrap-up and Next Steps

1. Reflect on the past 10 weeks, gather feedback, what was learned, what went well, what could be improved.
2. Gather feedback from members on their experience and what they'd like to see in future sessions.
3. Discuss plans for next sessions, possible guest speakers, events, or topics to cover.
4. Thank and congratulate everyone for their participation.
5. Each week should be interactive and encourage participation from all members, whether that's through discussions, Q&A sessions, or collaborative activities.
   - The more involved the members feel, the more beneficial the club will be.

## Weekly Meeting Agenda

Each meeting can have its unique structure depending on the nature of the session, but it's useful to have a general framework to ensure meetings are well-organized and efficient.
Below is an example of a simple structure for a one-hour meeting:

1. **Introduction** (5-10 minutes):
   - Welcome participants.
   - Share the agenda for the meeting.
   - Recap the last meeting (if applicable) and note any follow-ups.

2. **Main Agenda** (40-45 minutes):
   - This is where the main activities of the meeting will take place.
   - For a **workshop** or **lecture**, this will include the main presentation and demonstration.
   - For a **discussion**, this may involve presenting the topic and then facilitating a group discussion.
   - For a **hackathon** or **project showcase**, this would include the actual work or presentations.

3. **Q&A/Discussion** (5-10 minutes):
   - Reserve some time for attendees to ask questions or discuss the day's topic further.
   - Encourage participation and interaction.

4. **Conclusion and Looking Ahead** (2-3 minutes):
   - Wrap up the meeting and summarize key points.
   - Briefly mention what the next meeting will entail.
   - Thank everyone for their participation.

This is a very flexible structure and can be adjusted to better suit the type and purpose of each meeting.
For instance, a hands-on workshop might require more time for the main agenda, while a planning meeting might have more time allocated to discussion.
The key is to plan and communicate the schedule in advance so that attendees know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.
