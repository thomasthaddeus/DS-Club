1. Reflect on the past 10 weeks, gather feedback, what was learned, what went well, what could be improved.
2. Gather feedback from members on their experience and what they'd like to see in future sessions.
3. Discuss plans for next sessions, possible guest speakers, events, or topics to cover.
4. Thank and congratulate everyone for their participation.

<!-- Each week should be interactive and encourage participation from all members, whether that's through discussions, Q&A sessions, or collaborative activities.
   - The more involved the members feel, the more beneficial the club will be.-->
