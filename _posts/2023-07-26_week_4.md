Our repository is featured at [DS-Competition](https://github.com/thomasthaddeus/DS-Competition)

The focus of the competition is to use natural language processing to evaluate student summaries. The data is from the [CommonLit Readability Prize](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize/overview)
