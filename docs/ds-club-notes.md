We'll cover topics such as the different roles in data science (data analyst, data engineer, data scientist), the data science process (data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation), and the tools commonly used in the field (Python, R, SQL).

Week 3: Hands-on Workshop: Python for Data Science
We will dive into the Python programming language, focusing on the skills needed for data analysis. Members will be introduced to Python syntax and data structures, as well as important libraries for data science such as Pandas and Numpy. We'll practice reading data into Python, performing basic data cleaning, and conducting a simple data analysis.

Week 4: Guest Lecture
For this session, we'll have a guest speaker from the industry or academia to share their experience and insights about data science. Topics might range from emerging trends, real-world applications, to career advice. A Q&A session will be included to allow club members to interact with the guest.

Week 5: Data Visualization Workshop
Data visualization plays a crucial role in data science. This week, we'll learn about the basic principles of data visualization and get hands-on experience creating plots and charts using libraries/tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot, or Tableau.

Week 6: Machine Learning Basics

We'll discuss basic algorithms, the concept of training and testing data, and the fundamentals of model evaluation. The session will also include a demonstration of a simple machine learning model using Python or another tool.

Week 7: Project Showcase
Members will have an opportunity to present their data science projects or analyses. This is a great way to share learning experiences, get feedback, and learn from peers.

Week 8: Mini Data Competition/Hackathon
We'll host a mini data competition or hackathon where members will form teams and solve a real-world data problem. This will be a fun, engaging way to apply learned skills.

Week 9: Data Ethics Discussion
This week, we'll engage in a meaningful discussion about the importance of ethics in data science, including real-world examples of ethical dilemmas. This will encourage members to think critically about the implications of their work.

Week 10: Wrap-up and Next Steps
In our final week, we'll reflect on the past 10 weeks, discuss what was learned, what went well, and what could be improved. We'll also collect feedback to improve future sessions and discuss plans for the club moving forward.

The key to our club's success is to make each week interactive and engaging, whether that's through discussions, Q&A sessions, or collaborative activities. Our aim is for all members to feel involved and gain the maximum benefit from their participation in the DS Club.

## Week 2 Overview

For Week 2, which focuses on the basics of data science, you could prepare the following materials:

**Slide Presentation**: You could create a slide deck covering all the key topics for this week. These include:

- Definition and scope of data science
- Overview of the data science process: data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation
- Different roles in data science: data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, etc.
- Tools commonly used in data science, such as Python, R, SQL, and specific libraries or frameworks associated with them.

**Reading Materials**: Recommend a few key resources (books, articles, blogs, or tutorials) that provide more information on the topics covered. Some suggestions are:

- "Data Science for Business" by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett
- "The Data Science Handbook" by Field Cady and Carl Shan
- Blog posts or articles from Towards Data Science, KDnuggets, or other reputable sources
- Relevant sections from the Data Science Wikipedia page

**Interactive Activities**: Plan a few interactive activities or discussions to engage the members. This could be a quiz on the basic terminologies or a group discussion about how data science is applied in different industries.

**Video Materials**: If possible, include video materials such as online lectures or TED talks that explain the basics of data science in an easily digestible manner. Examples include videos from Khan Academy, Coursera, or other educational platforms.

**Q&A Session**: Allocate some time for a question-and-answer session. This will allow the members to clarify their doubts and deepen their understanding of the material covered.

**Next Steps**: Finally, provide a preview of the next session (Week 3: Hands-on Workshop: Python for Data Science) and any pre-requisites or preparation that members should complete beforehand.

Remember, the goal of Week 2 is to give members a comprehensive understanding of what data science is, including the key concepts, tools, and roles in the field. All materials should be geared towards achieving this objective in an engaging and interactive manner.
