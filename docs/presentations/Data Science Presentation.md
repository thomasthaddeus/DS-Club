1. **Introduction (3 minutes)**

   - **What is Data Science? (1 minute)**: Start by defining data science as a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

   - **Importance of Data Science (2 minutes)**: Discuss the importance of data science in today's data-driven world. You can mention how businesses use data science to make informed decisions, improve customer experience, optimize operations, and create new products or services.

2. **Data Science Terminologies and Concepts (7 minutes)**

   - **Key Terms (3 minutes)**: Define and explain key terms such as:
     - Data: Raw, unorganized facts or details that alone might not make much sense.
     - Information: Data that has been processed in a way that it's meaningful and useful.
     - Big Data: Large amounts of data that can be analyzed for insights leading to better decisions and strategic moves.
     - Machine Learning: A type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed.
     - Artificial Intelligence: A branch of computer science aiming to build machines capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence.

   - **Concept of Data Science (4 minutes)**: Discuss the concept of data science and its components. You can explain how it involves using automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract insight from them. Data science is about uncovering findings from data, and it's a process that involves several steps, from data collection and cleaning to doing in-depth analysis.

3. **Data Science Process (7 minutes)**

   - **Steps in the Data Science Process (5 minutes)**: Discuss each step in detail:
     - Data Gathering: This is the first step where data is collected from various sources which could be in structured or unstructured format.
     - Data Cleaning: This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or redundancies.
     - Data Exploration: This step involves exploring and analyzing the data to discover patterns, trends, and outliers.
     - Model Building: This step involves building predictive or descriptive models using machine learning algorithms.

   - **Example of the Data Science Process (2 minutes)**: Use a simple example to illustrate these steps. For instance, you could talk about how a company might use data science to predict customer churn. You would explain how the company collects customer data, cleans and preprocesses the data, explores the data to identify key factors that influence churn, and then builds a predictive model to predict which customers are most likely to churn.

4. **Job Roles in Data Science (5 minutes)**

   - **Data Analyst (1 minute)**: Explain that a data analyst's role is to take data and use it to help companies make better business decisions. This could involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and creating data visualizations.
   - **Data Scientist (1 minute)**: Discuss how a data scientist's role goes beyond that of a data analyst. Data scientists use their strong business acumen along with machine learning tools and statistical modeling to make predictions about future events in the business.
   - **Data Engineer (1 minute)**: Explain that a data engineer's role is to design, build, and manage the data infrastructure. They develop the architecture that helps analyze and process data in the way the organization needs it.
   - **Machine Learning Engineer (1 minute)**: Discuss how machine learning engineers design machine learning systems and run machine learning experiments using programming languages like Python and R.
   - **Overview (1 minute)**: Summarize by saying that while these roles can have a lot of overlap, each one has a distinct focus. The right role depends on what the individual or the company needs.

5. **Tools Used in Data Science (5 minutes)**

   - **Python (1 minute)**: Discuss Python as a versatile language used in data science due to its simplicity and wide range of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
   - **R (1 minute)**: Talk about R as a language specifically designed for statistical analysis and visualization.
   - **SQL (1 minute)**: Explain that SQL is used for managing and querying data stored in relational databases.
   - **Tableau (1 minute)**: Discuss how Tableau is a data visualization tool that helps in creating interactive dashboards to understand complex data.
   - **Overview (1 minute)**: Summarize by saying that the choice of tool depends on the task at hand, the requirements of the job, and the system that the company already has in place.

6. **Applications of Data Science (3 minutes)**

   - **Healthcare (1 minute)**: Discuss how data science is used in healthcare for predicting diseases, improving patient care, and optimizing medical practices.
   - **E-commerce (1 minute)**: Talk about how e-commerce companies like Amazon use data science for recommendation systems, customer segmentation, and sales forecasting.
   - **Finance (1 minute)**: Explain how data science is used in finance for credit scoring, algorithmic trading, and risk management.

7. **Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)**

   - **Summary (2 minutes)**: Recap the main points of your presentation. Reiterate the importance of data science in today's world, the key terminologies and concepts, the process, the job roles, the tools, and the applications.
   - **Q&A (3 minutes)**: Open the floor for questions. Encourage your audience to ask about any points they found particularly interesting or any areas they'd like to know more about.
