1. Basic algorithms in machine learning (linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, k-means clustering, etc.)
1. Understanding the concept of training and testing data
1. Basics of model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve, etc.)
1. Demonstration of a simple machine learning model using Python or another tool

## Weekly Meeting Agenda

Each meeting can have its unique structure depending on the nature of the session, but it's useful to have a general framework to ensure meetings are well-organized and efficient. Below is an example of a simple structure for a one-hour meeting:

1. **Introduction** (5-10 minutes):
   - Welcome participants.
   - Share the agenda for the meeting.
   - Recap the last meeting (if applicable) and note any follow-ups.

2. **Main Agenda** (40-45 minutes):
   - This is where the main activities of the meeting will take place.
   - For a **workshop** or **lecture**, this will include the main presentation and demonstration.
   - For a **discussion**, this may involve presenting the topic and then facilitating a group discussion.
   - For a **hackathon** or **project showcase**, this would include the actual work or presentations.

3. **Q&A/Discussion** (5-10 minutes):
   - Reserve some time for attendees to ask questions or discuss the day's topic further.
   - Encourage participation and interaction.

4. **Conclusion and Looking Ahead** (2-3 minutes):
   - Wrap up the meeting and summarize key points.
   - Briefly mention what the next meeting will entail.
   - Thank everyone for their participation.

This is a very flexible structure and can be adjusted to better suit the type and purpose of each meeting.
For instance, a hands-on workshop might require more time for the main agenda, while a planning meeting might have more time allocated to discussion.
The key is to plan and communicate the schedule in advance so that attendees know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.
