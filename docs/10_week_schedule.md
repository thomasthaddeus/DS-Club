Each week focuses on a different topic, which varies from basic concepts to hands-on workshops, networking, and project showcases.

## Weekly Topics

The key to our club's success is to make each week interactive and engaging, whether that's through discussions, Q&A sessions, or collaborative activities.
Our aim is for all members to feel involved and gain the maximum benefit from their participation in the DS Club.

1. **Week 1**: Overview of the DS Club
2. **Week 2**: Basics of Data Science
3. **Week 3**: Hands-on Workshop: Python for Data Science
4. **Week 4**: Guest Lecture
5. **Week 5**: Data Visualization Workshop
6. **Week 6**: Machine Learning Basics
7. **Week 7**: Project Showcase
8. **Week 8**: Mini Data Competition/Hackathon
9. **Week 9**: Data Ethics Discussion
10. **Week 10**: Wrap-up and Next Steps



## 10-week program

Data Science Club can be structured in numerous ways, depending on the needs and preferences of the members. This is a generic schedule and can be modified to better suit the needs of the club.
Remember to include some time for Q&A and open discussions in each session, and consider leaving some flexibility in the schedule to accommodate any unexpected changes or opportunities that may arise.

2. Introduction to Python programming language
3. Basic Python syntax and data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
4. Introduction to Python libraries for data science (Pandas, Numpy)
5. Reading data into Python and performing basic data cleaning
6. Simple data analysis using Python

### Week 4: Guest Lecture

1. A guest speaker from industry or academia to talk about their experience in data science.
2. Invite a guest speaker from industry or academia.
3. The lecture could be on a range of topics like emerging trends in data science, real-world applications, career advice, etc.
4. Include a Q&A session for club members to interact with the guest.

### Week 5: Data Visualization Workshop

1. Hands-on workshop on data visualization using tools like Matplotlib or Tableau.

6. Presentations by each team and selection of a winner
7. Remember that these are just basic overviews and the exact content would depend on the skill level and interests of the club members.
8. It's always a good idea to include hands-on exercises or examples where possible, to help members apply what they're learning.

### Week 9: Data Ethics Discussion

1. A session on the importance of ethics in data science, including real-world examples of ethical dilemmas.
2. Discuss the importance of ethics in data science.
3. Examples of ethical dilemmas and considerations in the field (privacy concerns, bias in data, transparency of algorithms, etc.).
4. Group discussion or debate on a specific ethical topic or case study.

### Week 10: Wrap-up and Next Steps

1. Reflect on the past 10 weeks, gather feedback, what was learned, what went well, what could be improved.
